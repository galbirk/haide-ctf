On one quite morning at Cyrebro inc. called that client with a problem with his computer...
According to his words, he had an unprotected file with important passwords that "turned unreadable". 
He suspects his computer "was hacked".
As a DFIR specialist at Cyrebro, you were assigned to the task. As you could not help remotely, the first thing you asked him to do is hibernate his computer and bring it to you.
Having the memory of the compromised computer, do what you know best.
Faster, the clock is ticking...
